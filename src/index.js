//This is the front end index.js that renders through my public html file/ 

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';
import './index.css';

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));




//How is this different from the index.js file I have in my ./server folder???
